        "body": "<p dir=\"ltr\">A number of big additions and changes have been detailed for patch 5.1 in <a href=\"/final-fantasy-xiv-online-a-realm-reborn/\" data-ref-id=\"5000-148228\">Final Fantasy XIV</a> via the latest <a href=\"https://www.twitch.tv/videos/496193945\" data-target=\"true\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Letter from the Producer Live</a>. This includes the <a href=\"https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/final-fantasy-xiv-51-is-a-huge-update-everything-y/2900-3118/2/\" data-ref-id=\"2900-3118\">Nier Automata alliance raid</a>, the <a href=\"https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/final-fantasy-xiv-51-is-a-huge-update-everything-y/2900-3118/6/\" data-ref-id=\"2900-3118\">Grand Cosmos dungeon</a>, and a bunch of class/job tweaks. These will all be implemented on October 29. While you can get our breakdown of a number of those new <a href=\"https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/final-fantasy-xiv-51-is-a-huge-update-everything-y/2900-3118/\" data-ref-id=\"2900-3118\">features in the upcoming 5.1 update</a>, we'll explain one in particular here: New Game+ for FFXIV.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">It has been talked about for a while, and New Game+ will get its first iteration in the next patch. You'll be able to replay story quests from all three expansions: Heavensward, Stormblood, and Shadowbringers. Don't worry about overwriting or resetting the work you've done; you'll maintain your character's overall story and job progress. Rather, it's the system for which you can experience the story again. It can work as another way to level up other classes/jobs, but you will not receive the quest's item rewards.</p><figure data-align=\"center\" data-size=\"large\" data-img-src=\"https://gamespot1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/scale_super/1574/15747411/3593870-ng.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-3593870\" data-ratio=\"0.57460840890354\" data-width=\"1213\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 1213px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:57.5%\" href=\"https://gamespot1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/scale_super/1574/15747411/3593870-ng.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-3593870\"><img alt=\"A look at the New Game+ screen.\" src=\"https://gamespot1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/original/1574/15747411/3593870-ng.jpg\" srcset=\"https://gamespot1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/original/1574/15747411/3593870-ng.jpg 1213w, https://gamespot1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/scale_medium/1574/15747411/3593870-ng.jpg 480w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1213px) 100vw, 1213px\" data-width=\"1213\"></a><figcaption>A look at the New Game+ screen.</figcaption></figure><p dir=\"ltr\">Both Heavensward and Stormblood quests will be divided into four parts--we're not entirely clear which exact quest or story beat each part starts. However, we know that Parts 1 and 2 cover the main expansion story while Parts 3 and 4 cover the post-release quests. Shadowbringers, on the other hand, is divided into two parts, which makes sense since it's the latest expansion with post-release quests rolling out at the moment. You won't be able to freely jump between quests as each chapter must be played from their beginning, and you'll have one auto-save slot for your New Game+ journey.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">It's an ambitious system for the MMORPG and there's still more for New Game+ in the future. It is not yet incorporating anything from the base game, A Realm Reborn, though that is in the works. Considering that the team is currently tweaking A Realm Reborn to condense its questline, cut out some filler, and make it a better experience for new players, we may have to wait for the revamp before it gets incorporated to the New Game+ system.</p>",

They ended the world of Fortnite as we know it by sucking everything into a black hole, and then for around a day it was just that black hole.</p><p><strong>Mary</strong>: The servers went down. If you started the game up, it allowed you to uninstall or quit, which was really shocking for a bunch of 12-year-olds, without a doubt.</p><p><strong>Lucy</strong>: I'm trying to think what the equivalent of that was when I was a kid. Oh, Sims expansion packs would get to like 75% install, and then just break. Or, you could install a Sims expansion pack and you would load up the game, and the Sims would all just be completely still and not move. That's the only frame of reference I have for wanting to play a game so badly and the game not cooperating, that I freaked out.</p><p><strong>Tamoor</strong>: Losing internet connection when your mp3 download is at 97%.</p><p><strong>Lucy</strong>: Oh, it's when your friend used to send you songs that they downloaded from iTunes, and then you open it on your computer and it says, \"You need the iTunes password of the person who bought it,\" and then they wouldn't give it to you.</p><p><strong>Mary</strong>: It's like being fairly through a game and then losing your save file.</p><p><strong>Tamoor</strong>: But that happened and people freaked out-understandably, in some regard.</p><p><strong>Lucy</strong>: What a PR move, though. I mean, that's nuts.</p><p><strong>Tamoor</strong>: It was, considering... I won't quote it, but that game, some people have broken down how much that game makes on a day-by-day basis, and it is more money than we could ever earn in three lifetimes combined. People have obviously invested a lot of time into that game, a lot of money into that game, and they freaked out when it happened.</p><p><strong>Mary</strong>: They asked for their money back.</p><p><strong>Tamoor</strong>: Yeah. I think the thing that I struggle with is, it's very obviously not going away. Kids aren't going to be like, \"Oh.\"</p><p><strong>Lucy</strong>: Kids don't understand that, no.</p><p><strong>Tamoor</strong>: Kids won't understand that, but my hope would have been a parent would have gone, \"It's not going away. Relax. It'll be back. It'll be all right.\"</p><p><strong>Mary</strong>: I thought it was funny to watch them freak out.</p><p><strong>Tamoor</strong>: I was like, \"Oh, it's a brief respite from Fortnite.\"</p><p><strong>Lucy</strong>: Not having to write new stories about Fortnite.</p><p><strong>Tamoor</strong>: Yeah, because honestly, perhaps I shouldn't say this, but I wrote through half of a story, which was basically about: this season has given me something I've wanted for so long, and that is an undeniable opportunity to not think about Fortnite for a while.</p><p>Because the reality of the situation is, wherever you are, there's a whole group of people out there that has to think about Fortnite [constantly]. On our side, we write about it and make videos about it, and it's... You can be like, \"Oh, you don't have to write about it.\" Well, yeah you're right, we don't have to write about it. But then also, we're giving up a lot of-</p><p><strong>Mary</strong>: SEO juice.</p><p><strong>Tamoor</strong>: ... SEO juice, traffic. That sounds really cynical, but the way I see it is: Yeah, I will happily write about Fortnite until the cows come home because that traffic is what gives everyone else the opportunity to follow a passion project, and to make a video that probably won't do as good numbers as a Fortnite video would, but it's something they care about.</p><p><strong>Mary</strong>: Jumping on that Fortnite grenade for your peers?</p><p><strong>Tamoor</strong>: Yeah, exactly. It's like some of the freedom to do that is afforded by what covering Fortnite does. That's one side of it, but then if you're a streamer... I was watching a streamer go through the transition process from one season to Chapter 2, which is what it is now, and those streamers have to be on all the time. If they have to play Fortnite all the time, their lives are consumed by Fortnite. I guarantee-</p><p><strong>Mary</strong>: They get burnt out.</p><p><strong>Tamoor</strong>: Yeah, I guarantee you there's probably a few that are like, \"Man, I don't have to think about Fortnite. Nothing's going to happen for at least 48 hours or 24 hours.\" I imagine there's some brief respite there, and even for people who work in marketing and various other ancillary industries that feed into Fortnite, it's something like... It was a break, right?</p><p><strong>Mary</strong>: Yeah. Fortnite is a machine, and you're 100% [right] that streamers go through burnout just like writers or any other trade where they genuinely want to do something else. But you have to understand that especially a full-time streamer, someone who's made a living out of it, they're not just really good at video games, they're gamifying their lives; they know that playing Fortnite min/maxes their chances at getting more subs, more donations, and more viewers. If you want to take that seriously and grow your channel, you play what is hot; you play the number one game, and the number one game for so long has been Fortnite and you cannot stop this. If you're trying to grow, you have to play Fortnite, and that is exhausting for a streamer who is craving something new.</p><p><strong>Tamoor</strong>: The interesting discussion is whether Epic is aware of that. They're aware of the fact that they have an industry, or they have this massive group of people who are either relying on the economy that Fortnite has created within the game and within streaming as a whole. They know that there are established people, there are people who are halfway there, there are people who are a quarter-way there, and there are people who are just starting there.</p><p>What are the realities of taking that game offline? It might serve them a purpose, but how much responsibility do they have to think about those people? I don't have the answer to that. As well as saying that, I bet you there are loads of Fortnite player-streamers that are probably like, \"Oh, thank God I don't have to think about Fortnite.\"</p><p><strong>Mary</strong>: You just play the next biggest thing. You just, now you're Apex Man.</p><p><strong>Tamoor</strong>: Exactly, but also it's... You have to do your due diligence and say there's also... there are Fortnite streamers there that were like, \"Oh, God, it's gone for a day. What do I do?\"</p><p><strong>Mary</strong>: Right. It's probably both. I think it's probably more relief than it is stress. I also think that, at the end of the day, we all know that the money machine, the million-dollar whale isn't going to go away forever. There was no one who probably looked at that black hole, besides maybe a couple of youths, that were like, \"It's never coming back.\" We all knew that it would come back, it was just a matter of time. But it is interesting to think about what a streamer would do if their cash cow, or the game that they play that everyone expects them to play is no longer around.</p><p><strong>Jake</strong>: I might be getting the streamer wrong, but didn't... I think summit1g, he was playing a lot of Fortnite because that's what was big. Then finally, he had a breaking one day and he's like, \"I can't play this game anymore.\" Then he switched to Sea of Thieves, and that was part of the reason why Sea of Thieves had that up-trend for a while there. Because he was just so tired of it, and he's like, \"I don't care. I don't care if I don't get any viewers. I don't care if I lose most of my viewers. I cannot play more of this game, I am so burnt out.\"</p><p>I don't know if things have changed since then; maybe he's back on Fortnite, maybe not, I don't really keep up with that kind of stuff. But I found that story super fascinating, and also just kind of inspiring because you hear about that a lot, streamers burning out on the games they're known for. It was kind of cool to hear someone who was just like, \"You know, I'm just going to play what I want.\"</p><p><strong>Mary</strong>: I'm going to play something I want.</p><p><strong>Jake</strong>: Maybe it won't work out. He's probably in the minority in the fact that, first of all, he was already pretty big so even that-</p><p><strong>Mary</strong>: He can afford to. That's the story you don't hear, is that he can afford to do it. We also have really large streamers that for whatever reason, like xQc today was like, \"I'm going to play Poly Bridge.\" And you know what? He had 20,000 people watching him play Poly Bridge, and that probably really helped the devs of Poly Bridge and that's rad, but he can afford to.</p><p>What you don't see are all the people who are trying to get at that level that have to play the main games, and I think that's that, as a company, we even are trying to encourage people to take a break from. It's just very difficult to tell someone who's trying to make it to also play what they want, and the statistics don't lie.</p><p><strong>Tamoor</strong>: Because I wasn't playing the game but I was writing about the game and covering it, I wanted to find someone who would focus on what was happening but also had a decent community around there. Watching this person was like, this person clearly at some point cared about this game and enjoyed this game; but it was this weird situation where it seemed like he was an auto-pilot, where the basic function of his existence was to entertain. But that meant he was playing the game, and any time someone said a word he would take it, process it and try to make it somehow entertaining.</p><p>There was a lady on the other side talking just normal things like, \"I'm going to get breakfast,\" and then he'd be playing and sing, \"Breakfaaaaaaaaast.\" It's like, this person's just taking external stimuli and [automatically trying to turn] it into something even remotely engaging. I was watching it and I was like, \"I feel so bad for this person.\" it was simple things like someone would ask him a question and he'd be singing the question back and then going, \"Oh, I need to answer this question.\" And external stimuli like, \"Oh, man, can see the shaking?\" And like, \"My phone's ringing. Oh, isn't that cool? The alarm is going off on my phone, isn't that weird?\" And you're like, \"No, dude. You don't have to turn every moment of your existence into entertainment.\"</p><p><strong>Mary</strong>: Content, yeah.</p><p><strong>Tamoor</strong>: That's the scary part of it. But then this person reached 200k viewers and I was like, \"I guess that's what it's all there for.\"</p><p><strong>Lucy</strong>: But at what cost?</p><p><strong>Tamoor</strong>: Yeah, but at what cost? It was just like, oh, man. Fortnite is just a weird, sticky subject that-</p><p><strong>Mary</strong>: It is.</p><p><strong>Tamoo</strong>r: For as much good as it does, it does a lot of things are questionable.</p>",

        "body": "<p><a href=\"/pokemon-go/\" data-ref-id=\"5000-449545\">Pokemon Go</a>'s <a href=\"https://www.gamespot.com/articles/pokemon-go-halloween-event-now-live-adds-costumed-/1100-6470506/\" data-ref-id=\"1100-6470506\">Halloween 2019 event</a> is now underway, and it's introduced a new Mythical Pokemon to the game: Darkrai. The nightmare-inducing Dark-type has started to appear in five-star Raid Battles, making this your first chance to catch it in Pokemon Go.</p><p>Darkrai will only be available in Raids until November 1, when Pokemon Go's Halloween event ends, so you'll want to make the most of this time if you're hoping to add a few to your collection. To help you out, we've rounded up some tips on how to battle and catch Darkrai below.</p><h2>How To Encounter Darkrai</h2><p>Like many other Legendary and Mythical Pokemon, Darkrai can be found as a tier-five Raid Boss, so to encounter one in the game, you'll need to head to a Gym where a Darkrai Raid is taking place. The Mythical Pokemon will periodically appear at Gyms, but your best bet for finding one will be during the Legendary Raid Hour events.</p><p>For one hour every Wednesday evening, more five-star Raids featuring Pokemon Go's current Legendary will take place, effectively guaranteeing you'll find a Raid. There will be two Darkrai Raid Hours before the Mythical Pokemon slinks back into the shadows. The first takes place on <strong>October 23</strong>, with the second following on <strong>October 30</strong>. Both events will run from <strong>6-7 PM local time</strong>.</p><p>To participate in a Raid Battle, you'll need to have a Raid Pass. You can either purchase these from Pokemon Go's in-game store or receive one for free when you spin the Photo Disc at a PokeStop; however, you can only hold one free Raid Pass at a time.</p><div data-embed-type=\"pinbox\" data-ref-id=\"4218\">  <p class=\"associated-header\">Pokemon Go News</p>\n\n<ul>\n              <li class=\"vertical-spacing-bottom\"><a href=\"/articles/pokemon-go-halloween-event-now-live-adds-costumed-/1100-6470506/\">Pokemon Go Halloween 2019 Event Coming Soon, Adds Costumed Starters, New Shiny Pokemon, And Darkrai</a></li>\n              <li class=\"vertical-spacing-bottom\"><a href=\"/articles/pokemon-go-adds-darkrai-to-raid-battles-for-a-limi/1100-6470658/\">Pokemon Go: Darkrai Now Available In Raids For A Limited Time</a></li>\n              <li class=\"vertical-spacing-bottom\"><a href=\"/articles/pokemon-go-bringing-back-regi-trio-for-a-limited-t/1100-6470535/\">Pokemon Go Bringing Back Regi Trio For A Limited Time Next Month</a></li>\n              <li><a href=\"/articles/pokemon-gos-november-2019-community-day-details-an/1100-6470604/\">Pokemon Go&#039;s November 2019 Community Day Announced, Features Chimchar</a></li>\n  </ul></div><p> </p><h2>Best Darkrai Counters</h2><p>Before you can have a chance to catch Darkrai, you'll first need to defeat it in battle, and it'll prove to be a tough opponent. Darkrai is a pure Dark-type, which means it is susceptible to Fighting, Bug, and Fairy, so you'll want to have Pokemon of these types on your team when you challenge it.</p><p>For Fighting-types, Machamp will likely be your best bet, particularly if it knows Counter and Dynamic Punch. Heracross and Scizor are both good Bug-types to use, the latter especially if it knows X-Scissor. Fairy-types are harder to find because they're among the rarest Pokemon in the game, but Gardevoir with Dazzling Gleam is a good choice.</p><p>However, two types you'll want to avoid using are Ghost and Psychic. Darkrai resists both elements, so those monsters won't fare very well against it. Note that Gardevoir is also part Psychic, but it takes neutral damage from Darkrai thanks to the fact it is also part Fairy, and if it knows the aforementioned Dazzling Gleam, it can hit the Mythical Pokemon super-effectively. Follow these tips and you should have no problem taking Darkrai down.</p>",

        "body": "<p>Dear Bethesda,</p><p>At E3 2018 you revealed that you're making Elder Scrolls VI, a new entry in the much loved Skyrim line of video game product. You showed us next to nothing, but everyone still lost their dang minds. And who could blame them? The *NOT REPRESENTATIVE OF THE ACTUAL GAME* trailer gave fans a brief look at a world they have so much invested in. The rousing orchestral rendition of the Elder Scrolls theme conjured memories of their fondest times with the franchise: filling a room full of cheese wheels, talking to a dog, turning dragons into Macho Man Randy Savage.</p><p>What we do know about it comes from Todd Howard himself, and it's that it's probably going to be some time until the game is ready for us to play. Howard said it's \"not coming anytime soon\" and, \"I don't even know what the world is going to be like when it comes out.\"</p><p>It might look more like Fallout if we're not careful, am I right folks?</p><p>Anyway, it's clear the game is still early in development, which means this is the perfect time for us, the gamers--the fans--to get our requests in ... Because that's definitely how game development works.</p><p>My request is a simple one and it involves including a character that has become <strong>critical</strong> to fantasy fiction. A figure that transcends intellectual properties and franchises to become part of the tapestry of the genre, as necessary as swords and shields, magic and mysticism, small cheese wheels and big cheese wheels. I am, of course, talking about the great and powerful Potion Seller.</p><div data-embed-type=\"video\" data-src=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R_FQU4KzN7A\" data-width=\"100%\" data-height=\"100%\"><iframe src=\"//cdn.embedly.com/widgets/media.html?src=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fembed%2FR_FQU4KzN7A%3Fwmode%3Dopaque%26feature%3Doembed&amp;wmode=opaque&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fwatch%3Fv%3DR_FQU4KzN7A&amp;image=https%3A%2F%2Fi.ytimg.com%2Fvi%2FR_FQU4KzN7A%2Fhqdefault.jpg&amp;key=4de70bf370934f33a67422a7b05063bd&amp;type=text%2Fhtml&amp;schema=youtube\" width=\"100%\" height=\"100%\" scrolling=\"no\" frameborder=\"0\" webkitAllowFullScreen mozallowfullscreen allowFullScreen></iframe></div><p>For those who aren't keeping up with all the modern greats in the fantasy genre, Potion Seller is a character created by Justin Kuritzkes for his magnum opus, a seminal piece of fantasy fiction titled, \"<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R_FQU4KzN7A\" data-target=\"true\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Double U, Double U, Double U Dot YouTube Dot Com Forward Slash Watch Question Mark V Equals R Underscore FQU4KzN7A</a>.\" The beloved story focuses on a single conversation between a knight and a merchant selling potions.</p><p>Although the scale of the story may be small, what it depicts is still impactful. The knight, preparing to go into battle, asks for the Potion Seller's \"strongest potions,\" to which the Potion Seller responds by rebuking his request. His potions, as it turns out, are too strong for the knight, according to the seller, and thus the knight would not be able to handle them.</p><p>The knight, exerting whatever authority he has, attempts to press on, demanding that the Potion Seller give him his \"strongest potions\" once again. \"My strongest potions will kill you, traveler, you can't handle my strongest potions,\" he replies. In this moment, the message behind the story becomes clear. You see, in the eyes of the Potion Seller, the knight is just another person, a \"traveler.\" Whatever accolades the knight has gathered in battle thus far are not important, for the seller, the power of his potions are all that matter and it is his responsibility to ensure that they are only given to those he has confidence in ... for their own good.</p><p>\"YOU BETTER GO TO A SELLER THAT SELLS WEAKER POTIONS,\" says Potion Seller, attempting to make the knight see sense.</p><p>The knight, taken back by the Potion Sellers unwavering morals and values, arrogantly asserts himself once again. \"I'm telling you right now,\" he begins, \"I'm going into battle, and I need <em>only</em> your strongest potions.\" The arrogance of the knight becomes clear. This is a story about hubris and how it can be the undoing of even the most self-assured heroes.</p><p>\"MY STRONGEST POTIONS WOULD KILL A DRAGON, LET ALONE A MAN,\" the Potion Seller clapeth back. \"YOU NEED A SELLER, THAT SELLS WEAKER POTIONS ... because my potions ARE TOO STRONG.\" The knight's desperate pleas are cast aside, \"YOU CAN'T HANDLE MY STRONGEST POTIONS. NO ONE CAN!!!!!!!! MY STRONGEST POTIONS ARE FIT FOR A BEAST LET ALONE A MAN.\"</p><p>In this moment, it becomes clear that \"Double U, Double U, Double U Dot YouTube Dot Com Forward Slash Watch Question Mark V Equals R Underscore FQU4KzN7A\" is also the story of how those that the masses would dismiss as a lowly member of society--a mere potion seller--can wield strength even greater than champions of the realm.</p><p>He may be branded \"a rascal with no respect for knights\" but, ultimately, the Potion Seller stuck to his convictions. He respected the power of his potions and, in the face of a would-be hero, he stuck up for himself, begging the question: Who was the real hero?</p><figure data-align=\"center\" data-size=\"large\" data-img-src=\"https://gamespot1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/original/43/434805/3594322-screen%20shot%202019-10-18%20at%2012.57.15%20pm.png\" data-ref-id=\"1300-3594322\" data-ratio=\"0.65474974463739\" data-width=\"979\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 979px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:65.5%\" href=\"https://gamespot1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/original/43/434805/3594322-screen%20shot%202019-10-18%20at%2012.57.15%20pm.png\" data-ref-id=\"1300-3594322\"><img alt=\"Answer: It's the Potion Seller\" src=\"https://gamespot1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/original/43/434805/3594322-screen%20shot%202019-10-18%20at%2012.57.15%20pm.png\" srcset=\"https://gamespot1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/original/43/434805/3594322-screen%20shot%202019-10-18%20at%2012.57.15%20pm.png 979w, https://gamespot1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/scale_medium/43/434805/3594322-screen%20shot%202019-10-18%20at%2012.57.15%20pm.png 480w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 979px) 100vw, 979px\" data-width=\"979\"></a><figcaption>Answer: It's the Potion Seller</figcaption></figure><p>In The Elder Scrolls VI, whatever it may become, players will inevitably be cast as the hero and go on a journey to save the lands, untangle political turmoil, and become a legendary figure for the peoples of the lands to sing songs about and deify. But there's also an opportunity to make the little characters count, to remind adventurers that, while they may be on a quest to decide the fates of many, others have their own destinies, be it collecting wheels of cheese or choosing who to sell potions to.</p><p>And who better to remind people about this than arguably the most important representation of the little-guy-standing-up-for-himself fantasy archetype, the Potion Seller. He deserves to be in The Elder Scrolls VI. He is too important to fantasy fiction not to be. To that end, we at GameSpot have <a href=\"http://chng.it/sfPxpRCVPM\" data-target=\"true\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">created a petition </a>to urge Bethesda to reach out to acclaimed author <a href=\"https://twitter.com/justinkuritzkes?lang=en\" data-target=\"true\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Justin Kuritzkes</a> and bring Potion Seller to The Elder Scrolls VI. Please sign and support this noble cause.</p><p>Thank you,</p><p>GameSpot's Very Online Staff Members</p>",

It opens with facts about alligator attacks as a segway into a motion comic version of the alternate opening. It follows a family packing up, trying to stay ahead of the hurricane descending on their state. Eventually, the family gets trapped in rising waters, and the husband gets out to help move a car trapped in the road. An alligator attacks, brutally maiming and killing the father and eventually, the rest of the family.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">Crawl's theatrical release opens with Haley (Kaya Scodelario) at a swim meet in college, flashing back to the lessons her father taught her as a child. She then ventures to her hometown to check on her father during a category 5 hurricane. It's a bit of a build towards the eventual threat the protagonists face, giant alligators.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">While the motion comic is extremely cool, it was thankfully never the opening to the theatrical release of the movie. What makes Crawl such a successful and fun horror film is the slow build and rising tension as Haley and her father are trapped in their house. You know there's an eventual threat looming down the road, and the choice to exclude alligators from the first act entirely makes the monster's reveal oh so much more satisfying.</p><figure data-align=\"center\" data-size=\"large\" data-img-src=\"https://gamespot1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/original/1562/15626911/3594330-crawl.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-3594330\" data-ratio=\"1.2643504531722\" data-width=\"662\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 662px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:126.4%\" href=\"https://gamespot1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/original/1562/15626911/3594330-crawl.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-3594330\"><img alt=\"No Caption Provided\" src=\"https://gamespot1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/original/1562/15626911/3594330-crawl.jpg\" srcset=\"https://gamespot1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/original/1562/15626911/3594330-crawl.jpg 662w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 662px) 100vw, 662px\" data-width=\"662\"></a></figure><h2 dir=\"ltr\">Crawl on Blu-ray</h2><h3><del>$40</del> $22</h3><p><a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Crawl-Blu-ray-Kaya-Scodelario/dp/B07TMRRFS7?tag=gamespotdeals-20\" data-target=\"true\" data-embed-type=\"buylink\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\" class=\"js-lead-click-event-tracking\" data-event-tracking=\"{&quot;lead_type&quot;:&quot;deal&quot;,&quot;merchant&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;link_location&quot;:&quot;Buy Button&quot;,&quot;lead_dest_url&quot;:&quot;https:\\/\\/www.amazon.com\\/Crawl-Blu-ray-Kaya-Scodelario\\/dp\\/B07TMRRFS7?tag=gamespotdeals-20&quot;}\" data-vars-buy-link=\"https://www.amazon.com/Crawl-Blu-ray-Kaya-Scodelario/dp/B07TMRRFS7?tag=gamespotdeals-20\">See on Amazon</a></p><p dir=\"ltr\">In GameSpot's <a href=\"https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/crawl-review-the-gator-on-human-horror-movie-we-de/1900-6417214/\">review of Crawl</a>, Rafael Motamayor said, \"Crawl's brisk runtime of just under 90 minutes helps make it the perfect antidote for this summer of overly long movies, as Alexandre Aja delivers a throwback to the heyday of aquatic horror movies that can do for lakehouses in Florida what Jaws did for beaches.

We're seeing the toughest waves of the Shadowkeep expansion's Nightmare Hunt activity showing up, as well as a new quest for a rare and unique Exotic weapon: Leviathan's Breath.</p><p>Bungie detailed the first month of live content in Shadowkeep and the Season of the Undying on its <a href=\"https://www.gamespot.com/articles/destiny-2s-updated-calendar-new-shadowkeep-dungeon/1100-6469816/\" data-ref-id=\"1100-6469816\">content calendar</a>, which includes Nightmare Hunts; a new dungeon; the upcoming Halloween event, Festival of the Lost; and the Final Assault portion of the Vex Offensive activity. As Bungie noted in its latest <a href=\"https://www.bungie.net/en/Explore/Detail/News/48319\" data-target=\"true\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">This Week at Bungie blog post</a>, the Leviathan's Breath quest becomes available on October 22, kicked off by visiting Banshee-44 in the Tower.</p><p>We already know a little about what to expect from Leviathan's Breath. The Exotic weapon is a Void bow that uses Heavy ammo. It's capable of firing heavy bolt that can stagger unshielded enemies. When the bow is fully drawn, it also creates a concussive blast that knocks back enemies.</p><div><div data-embed-type=\"pinbox\" data-ref-id=\"4195\">  <p class=\"associated-header\">Destiny 2 Recent News</p>\n\n<ul>\n              <li class=\"vertical-spacing-bottom\"><a href=\"/articles/where-is-xur-today-destiny-2-exotics-location-weap/1100-6470680/\">Where Is Xur Today?

If recent quests are any indication, it'll probably include several steps--including one or two specific missions. The mission is only available if you've purchased the season pass for the Season of the Undying, though. It was included with Shadowkeep, but if you're playing the free-to-play New Light version of Destiny 2, you're out of luck for Leviathan's Breath.</p><p>We'll have a full guide for Leviathan's Breath after it releases with Tuesday's weekly reset.

        "body": "<p dir=\"ltr\">For an agent of the death, Felix is an oddly loveable goofball. He doesn’t wear a pitch-black cloak or brandish an ominous scythe, but his job is pretty much what you think it is. He inserts himself into everyday life, manipulating events from the shadows to execute a well-orchestrated plan of death. It’s grim work, but that doesn’t mean he can’t have fun while doing it. Felix cannot contain his love of music, treating each level as a dance floor as he shuffles, twirls and wobbles through them. Felix is charming, but that energy doesn’t translate over to the puzzles you have to solve.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">As an employee of the Ministry of Death, your job as Felix is to set up the deaths of mortals on earth. These are multi-staged tasks, taking place over numerous levels contained in themed chapters that span various time periods. The first, taking place in a long-forgotten ice age, has you setting up the comedic death of a nomadic hunter by dropping a moose head on him and attracting the attention of his companion nearby, who doesn't hesitate to use a spear on his mistaken prey. Each death in <a href=\"/felix-the-reaper/\" data-ref-id=\"5000-485885\">Felix the Reaper</a> hits an entertaining punchline, letting you witness all of your previous efforts unfold in a satisfying way. Just like the board game Mouse Trap, it's fun to see each individual piece of each puzzle link up, but it’s an absolute chore getting to that point.</p><figure data-align=\"center\"

shadows, so you primarily reposition objects to cast their shadows along paths you plan to take. You can shift the direction of the sun by 90 degrees at a time, too, bathing new areas in dangerous sunlight and opening up new paths for you to safely walk through. Most puzzles work this way, with you moving a specific object from one side of the level to the other and using an assortment of other objects to construct your path. It rarely deviates from this. Felix the Reaper shows its entire hand within the first handful of levels and never evolves further.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">The formula grows tedious rather quickly. Getting to the end of a level isn’t rewarding but a relief as you look back at all the steps you had to take to get there. Felix the Reaper makes it clear that all of its puzzles can be solved in just a handful of moves (which you’ll need to do on subsequent replays if you want to unlock some bonus stages), but it dangles this fact in front of you like a cheeky taunt when you’ve spent the better half of an hour undoing mistakes move by move before you finally find the right combination of steps to succeed.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">The culprit here is the inflexibility of the puzzles, which require extremely specific movements to solve. Sometimes this boils down to shifting an object one block at a time to carry a shadow with you as you go, which is bogged down by the same animations to pick up and place items. When you make a mistake it’s not immediately clear that you have, and when you eventually succumb to asking for a hint you’ll likely have to backtrack through your last few moves to reset your position and work towards the solution. Even with hints of where to place an item, there's no help in getting you there. And since there are specific steps you have to take, it can take a frustrating number of attempts to just set down one piece of a larger puzzle.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">Control issues don’t make this any easier. Playing on a Nintendo Switch, I struggled to get comfortable with the camera controls, which would sometimes result in me losing my tiny mouse-like cursor from view entirely. There’s a button to re-center the cursor in the middle of the screen, thankfully, but it occurred far too frequently for me to ever feel confident in making quick moves, another requirement if you want to complete levels fast enough.</p><figure data-align=\"center\" data-size=\"large\" data-img-src=\"https://gamespot1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/original/1575/15759911/3594397-2019101220153000-92e995c028cff61bf93013e0fec4b8c9.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-3594397\" data-ratio=\"0.5625\" data-width=\"1280\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 1280px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:56.3%\" href=\"https://gamespot1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/original/1575/15759911/3594397-2019101220153000-92e995c028cff61bf93013e0fec4b8c9.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-3594397\"><img alt=\"No Caption Provided\" src=\"https://gamespot1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/original/1575/15759911/3594397-2019101220153000-92e995c028cff61bf93013e0fec4b8c9.jpg\" srcset=\"https://gamespot1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/original/1575/15759911/3594397-2019101220153000-92e995c028cff61bf93013e0fec4b8c9.jpg 1280w, https://gamespot1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/scale_medium/1575/15759911/3594397-2019101220153000-92e995c028cff61bf93013e0fec4b8c9.jpg 480w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1280px) 100vw, 1280px\" data-width=\"1280\"></a></figure><p dir=\"ltr\">It’s a pity that actually solving Felix the Reaper’s puzzles is so unrewarding when it has so much character lovingly imbued into its presentation. Felix is never idle in a stage, always breaking out a dance move to the pulsating beats reverberating through his headphones. His ultimate goal is to eventually bump into the love of his life while out doing his job--she's a lingerie-clad agent of the Ministry of Life seeking to undo the very actions Felix is undertaking. It’s a strange but comical narrative layer that doesn’t serve much else beyond giving you a reason to hop from one chapter to the next, but it’s a setup that's so absurd that you can’t help but find it somewhat endearing.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">Visually, Felix the Reaper is unique, too. The humans you eventually lead to their deaths are made up of strange shapes and sizes, with ghoulish scribbles for faces that emote in uncomfortable ways. It's not beautiful, per se, but it does establish a look and feel for the game that really makes it stand out. Felix’s marshmallow-like form complements his energetic dance moves well, animating with a kinetic motion that doesn’t wear over time. He reminds me a lot of Baymax from Big Hero 6 in this regard--he's fun to just watch in motion, and I desperately wanted to give him a hug when he was sad.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">But there’s no amount of visual charm or dark humor in its violent deaths that make the effort of sticking with Felix the Reaper worth it. It’s a thoroughly enticing setting and premise that is misguided by puzzle mechanics that aren’t that aren't fun to play around with, and then fail to meaningfully build on their foundations in any way after that. Felix the Reaper might be able to drown out his surroundings with music, but that doesn't make his job any less mundane to perform.</p>",

Fast-traveling from the mines near its titular town to its main street, the two furthest points on the map, only saves you about a minute or so of travel time. But the game wants its small village to matter, as it spends several hours familiarizing you with the small area and its residents. Its gameplay works the same way, doing for card-battlers what Pokemon did for party-focused, turn-based RPGs: distilling it into something the average person can wrap their head around.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">And it works, sometimes. When you face down an imposing monster and cobble together a hard-earned win with all the tools at your disposal, it can make the equipment upgrading, crafting systems, and myriad currencies of other games feel like bloat. But more often, Little Town Hero doesn't leave the strict confines it creates for itself; instead, it plays things safe by constraining your options so things don't get too out of hand. While that occasionally produces some challenging moments, battles quickly begin to repeat themselves, making you wish you could see what its combat might be capable of if it weren't afraid to take more risks.</p><div data-embed-type=\"video\" data-ref-id=\"2300-6451309\" data-src=\"/videos/little-town-hero-boss-battle-gameplay/2300-6451309/\" data-width=\"100%\" data-height=\"100%\"><iframe

village is Axe, a young troublemaker quickly thrust into defending his home from monsters after he acquires a red stone that gives him an edge against them in battle. Because the village is protected by a castle and surrounded by steep cliffs, no one knows where the monsters are coming from, so Axe and his friends begin tracking down their origins.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">The crux of Little Town Hero is its turn-based gameplay, which borrows elements from card games but throws in a couple of twists. Fights revolve around a small deck of cards, called Ideas. Cards can be red (which have high attack values and can damage the opponent directly), yellow (which can fight multiple times a turn as long as they have the health for it, but can't damage your opponent), or blue (which don't have attack or defense values but activate powerful effects). The goal in most fights is to break all three of your opponent's hearts by destroying all of their cards in a single turn by having them trade hits with yours, then attacking them directly.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">Unfortunately, this setup lacks key aspects of other card games. The most glaring omission is that you can't actually build a deck of your own; for most of the game, you're stuck with a deck that caps out at just 13 cards. You can't alter or customize which cards you bring to battle, so standard battles play out predictably; you look at the defense of your opponent's cards, match them with the cards that can break them, and see if your hand can break theirs. Some cards have special effects, but you won't see any outlandish gameplay mechanics; most effects either buff your current cards, deal damage, or add another card to your hand. Fights get boring quickly, especially after you upgrade your cards by working your way through the skill tree using the Eureka points earned from fights.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">You can also mitigate much of the luck that factors into most other card games, which makes it easier to get the cards you need but also drives home how simple the strategy behind each fight is. In order to survive longer fights, you need to recycle cards by either losing a heart or spending BP (a resource you build whenever you destroy all of your opponent's cards but don't have a card to break through and damage them directly). You can even swap out cards in your hand for those in your deck at the cost of BP.</p><figure data-align=\"center\" data-size=\"large\" data-img-src=\"https://gamespot1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/original/1575/15759911/3593159-little%20town%20hero%20screenshot%20%282%29.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-3593159\" data-ratio=\"0.5625\" data-width=\"2560\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 2560px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:56.3%\" href=\"https://gamespot1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/original/1575/15759911/3593159-little%20town%20hero%20screenshot%20%282%29.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-3593159\"><img alt=\"No Caption Provided\" src=\"https://gamespot1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/scale_super/1575/15759911/3593159-little%20town%20hero%20screenshot%20%282%29.jpg\" srcset=\"https://gamespot1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/original/1575/15759911/3593159-little%20town%20hero%20screenshot%20%282%29.jpg 2560w, https://gamespot1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/scale_super/1575/15759911/3593159-little%20town%20hero%20screenshot%20%282%29.jpg 1280w, https://gamespot1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/scale_medium/1575/15759911/3593159-little%20town%20hero%20screenshot%20%282%29.jpg 480w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1280px) 100vw, 1280px\" data-width=\"1280\"></a></figure><p dir=\"ltr\">While this curbs the element of chance that can sometimes be aggravating in card games, it also emphasizes just how often you end up using the same strategies each fight. Already used the card you needed to pierce through a boss' defense to win the last round? No problem; with 3 BP, you can revive your entire deck and add that car right back into your hand. You end up sticking to one or two strategies and running them time and again because, again, your deck is made up of just 13 cards.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">Because of how small your deck is and how well you can mitigate the element of chance, decision-making is crucial, and I did have a few of the a-ha moments where I was backed into a corner but, through a series of smart decisions, came out on top. But those moments quickly give way to going on autopilot. There might be a few deviations based on whatever tricks your opponent pulls or which cards you draw in the first turn, but at some point, I was able to run my plan of making several of my defensive cards invincible, steamrolling whatever offense the boss had, and hitting them for obscene amounts of damage in a single turn.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">Boss fights are a little more exciting, since they introduce a couple of strategic layers. Instead of fighting in place, you take on monsters across a large swath of the village, mapped out like a small board, moving a random number of spaces each turn (though you can control where you move with certain cards). Most spaces on the board have a special effect when you land on them, granting access to an ally who can deal direct damage, allowing you to combine two cards into one, or letting you use certain cards to activate explosive barrels or cannons. Some villagers might even have suggestions, like punching a monster in the nose, that add new, one-use cards to your deck specific to that fight. Planning out where I'd travel across multiple turns depending on which cards I had that turn made from some well-timed plays that won me some fights.</p><figure data-align=\"center\" data-size=\"large\" data-img-src=\"https://gamespot1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/original/1575/15759911/3593160-little%20town%20hero%20screenshot%20%2810%29.png\" data-ref-id=\"1300-3593160\" data-ratio=\"0.5625\" data-width=\"1920\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 1920px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:56.3%\" href=\"https://gamespot1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/original/1575/15759911/3593160-little%20town%20hero%20screenshot%20%2810%29.png\" data-ref-id=\"1300-3593160\"><img alt=\"No Caption Provided\" src=\"https://gamespot1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/scale_super/1575/15759911/3593160-little%20town%20hero%20screenshot%20%2810%29.png\" srcset=\"https://gamespot1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/original/1575/15759911/3593160-little%20town%20hero%20screenshot%20%2810%29.png 1920w, https://gamespot1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/scale_super/1575/15759911/3593160-little%20town%20hero%20screenshot%20%2810%29.png 1280w, https://gamespot1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/scale_medium/1575/15759911/3593160-little%20town%20hero%20screenshot%20%2810%29.png 480w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1280px) 100vw, 1280px\" data-width=\"1280\"></a></figure><p dir=\"ltr\">To counter these powerful bonuses, bosses offer up the kind of challenge the rest of the game lacks. Each boss has its own gimmick that nudges you toward different strategies; one boss might counterattack when you hurt it (encouraging you to find more indirect ways of wearing it down), or introduce cards that add a short timer to all of your moves until they're destroyed, forcing you to be quick and possibly screw up. For the first half of the game, I had a tough time against monsters, since it seemed like they always had the upper hand. As I upgraded my deck, that tide slowly shifted.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">This doesn't make later boss fights breezy--some of them are tough. But even here, because you don't have that many options to choose from, your path to victory doesn't feel personal or creative. It also doesn't help that during boss fights, both sides gain a protective shield that has to be whittled down before hearts will take damage, which makes boss fights take longer than regular fights--certain battles took the better part of an hour to get through. The combination of the gradually lowered difficulty and increased length of battles meant I knew I'd emerge victorious, but I dreaded the 15 to 20 turns it'd take to get there.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">Outside of battles, you can trek back and forth across the village to run errands for shopkeepers and complete side quests that earn you Eureka points. But the village itself isn't big enough to hold your attention for long; there are no other meaningful ways to engage with anyone outside of the couple of times they might ask you to get something for them, if at all. The only resource you have are Eureka points, so there are no minigames, equipment to buy, or anything else that might give combat more depth or provide an alternative from all the card-battling. The town only comes alive when monsters attack it.</p><blockquote><p dir=\"ltr\">Little Town Hero finds some success in avoiding some of the complex systems and tedious menus that can bog down other card games and RPGs, but it ends up suffering for it.</p></blockquote><p dir=\"ltr\">The story you unravel along the way and strings all the fights together is somewhat involved, but predictable and boring. Discovering the origin of all the monster attacks has a couple of twists, but mostly leads to a predictable story that moves at a crawl. Characters are largely forgettable, quickly fall into archetypes, and play out their roles without much room for nuance. A couple of later moments get some emotional weight thanks to a strong score from Undertale creator Toby Fox and longtime Pokemon composer Hitomi Sato, but characters are too shallow to hold up their end of the bargain, and the town doesn't have enough going on to make it worth exploring beyond where quests tell you to go.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">Little Town Hero finds some success in avoiding some of the complex systems and tedious menus that can bog down other card games and RPGs, but it ends up suffering for it. Keeping your card options limited allows you to approach encounters with clever instead of relying on luck of the draw, but the deck size is too limited to break the mounting doldrum of subsequent fights. And while I did get to know this town pretty well, that's because of how small and suffocating it feels as it refuses to push outside its own boundaries.</p>",

        "body": "<p dir=\"ltr\">The dichotomy of beauty and violence has always been a driving theme in The Witcher series. The Northern Realms' gorgeous vistas are dotted with war-torn battlefields, kindness--no matter how fleeting it may be--is often juxtaposed with savagery, and even the warmest characters have a cold and calculated side to them. That neverending tug-of-war is ever-present in The Witcher 3, even when its stripped-down visuals may obscure some of that beauty.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">Everything is here in the Nintendo Switch version--<a href=\"/the-witcher-3-wild-hunt/\" data-ref-id=\"5000-167462\">The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt</a>, its two expansions, Hearts of Stone and Blood and Wine, and all of its DLC. The main game alone offers dozens of superb quests filled with interesting characters, fantastic twists, and rewarding combat encounters. As Kevin VanOrd said in <a href=\"https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/the-witcher-3-wild-hunt-review/1900-6416135/\">GameSpot's original review</a>, \"Excellence abounds at every turn in this open-world role-playing game.\" The same is mostly true for the Nintendo Switch version.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">As you'd expect, the visuals have been pared down significantly. The textures are muddied, the draw-distances are reined in, and the resolution has taken a hit. These issues are exacerbated during docked play. While it technically runs at a higher frame rate and resolution docked, these visual issues are all the more noticeable when projected onto a larger screen.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">The standard Nintendo Switch's 6.2-inch screen does a great job of hiding the blemishes. Even though it's running at a lower resolution, the smaller screen gives it a much crisper look, so the poor textures and pop-in are less apparent. If you do plan on playing it in handheld mode, you can, thankfully, adjust the size of the HUD to make things easier to read.</p><figure data-align=\"center\" data-size=\"large\"

players, the visual downgrade may require some getting used to. However, focusing solely on The Witcher 3's visuals does this port a disservice. Four years later, the game is still massive in scope, and seeing the battle-scarred swamps of Velen, jagged peaks of Skellige, and sprawling countryside of Toussaint on a technically inferior platform is still a sight to behold.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">More importantly, the grittier look of the Switch port doesn't affect The Witcher 3's core gameplay. The combat and exploration may be smoother on a PC, Xbox One X, or PS4 Pro, but I found performance to be consistent throughout a wide variety of combat encounters and locales. After nearly 30 hours, I haven't experienced any significant frame rate dips. Even the swamps in Velen--an area notorious for causing frame rate issues on PS4 and Xbox One--are comparable to the rest of the experience on Switch. According to developer CD Projekt Red, the frame rate should range between 24 and 30 frames per second. In populated areas like Novigrad, the frame rate dipped to the lower end of that range. Given the slower pace of The Witcher 3, I never found these dips to be an issue, even in the heat of combat.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">The Witcher 3's visual prowess may have been a selling point for some in 2015, but the Nintendo Switch version is a reminder that there is far more to this adventure than a pretty picture. Even today, there are few games that can rival the storytelling and worldbuilding on display here. Nothing is as simple as it seems, and every thread you pull on reveals enticing new details about this world and its characters.</p><blockquote><p dir=\"ltr\">The Nintendo Switch version is a reminder that there is far more to this adventure than a pretty picture</p></blockquote><p dir=\"ltr\">The vast web of decisions and consequences is just as impressive as it was in 2015. While it may not be apparent on your first playthrough, your actions--both big and small--can have serious repercussions, even if you were trying to do the right thing. What's more impressive is how well fleshed-out each of these paths are and how they ebb and flow through main quests and side quests. While many outcomes are bittersweet by design, none feel underdeveloped.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">Where The Witcher 3 continues to shine is in its many deeply human stories. While the political aspects of the main story give context to the world and the characters that inhabit it, it's the interactions Geralt has with its denizens that gives weight to the experience. There are no good guys or bad guys. There are just people fighting to find hope in an oppressive world. Many of the quests provoke questions like: Would you hurt others for those you love? Can even the most vile of men be forgiven? How far can fear drive someone?</p><p dir=\"ltr\">The superb storytelling continues in the game's two expansions. Hearts of Stone and Blood and Wine. While not necessary to the main narrative, these two expansions are thoughtful addendums to Geralt's story. Blood and Wine in particular is a heartfelt send-off for the storied series. If you're jumping back into the game and just want to experience these, you can skip to them right when you load it up for the first time.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">Although the Nintendo Switch might not be the best platform to play The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt, it's still a fantastic experience that shouldn't be missed. If you are looking to replay The Witcher 3 and bask in its detail and beauty, the Switch port may not quite scratch that itch. However, what makes this game excellent isn't its graphics, but the powerful stories it tells, and those are as vivid as ever on Switch.</p><p> </p>",
